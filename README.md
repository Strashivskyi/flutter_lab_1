# flutter_lab_1

Main part of the app is created using these tutorials:
https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab
https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt2#0

It creates an endless list of word pairs in English using english_words package. There is also an icon near each word pair, which you can check. All the word pairs you check go to the certain list. You can see this list by tapping an icon in the right upper conner of the app.

My customization is:
1) transliteration of english letters into cyrillic in the list of saved pairs;
2) icons of different colors near each word pair, which show the difficulcy of these pairs depending on their lenght.
I used translit pachage for transliteration and string_validator for counting letters in word pairs.

Here is how it looks like:
